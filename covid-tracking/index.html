		<p>The vertical pale grey bars represent confirmed cases, but with a small adjustment for test positivity (ie the proportion of tests for Covid-19 that return positive on any one day). The approach to adjusting for positivity is as described in [this blog post](/blog/2020/05/09/covid-population-incidence), with a power parameter of 0.1. Victoria's test positivity over the last few months is shown in this chart, which makes clear that the proportion of positive tests is low (ie good) by international standards:</p>

		<h2>Source data</h2>
		<p>The case numbers for <b>Victoria</b> are collated by <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q5gdePANXci8enuiS4oHUJxcxC13d6bjMRSicakychE/edit#gid=1437767505'>The Guardian</a>. I use the daily increase in cumulative cases as my initial estimates of incidence. Note that these are sometimes slightly less than the daily figures announced by press release, <a href='https://twitter.com/NickEvershed/status/1285709049489760256'>because of adjustments to previous days' case numbers</a> which cannot be allocated to specific dates. The estimates would be marginally improved by using a cleaner set of data that nets out these values closer to when they happened.</p>
		
		<p>The case numbers for <b>New South Wales</b> come from <a href= 'https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/c647a815-5eb7-4df6-8c88-f9c537a4f21e/resource/2f1ba0f3-8c21-4a86-acaf-444be4401a6d/download/covid-19-cases-by-notification-date-and-likely-source-of-infection.csv'>NSW Health</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The data on number of tests comes from The Guardian.</p>

		<h2>Estimation methods</h2>		
		<p>This analysis is done with the EpiNow2 R package, whose primary authors are at the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine. It takes into account estimated delays from infection, incubation and reporting. The approach is described in <a href='/blog/2020/07/18/victoria-r-convolution'>this blog post</a> from July 2020. </p>
		
		<p>The NSW data are published by likely source of infection, but currently the EpiNow2 method cannot take this into account in estimating effective reproduction number. I am sticking with the EpiNow2 approach because it has the best available adjustments for uncertain delay and right-truncation of case numbers, despite this limitation for now.</p>

		<h2>Code</h2>
		The code for this analysis is <a href='https://github.com/ellisp/blog-source/blob/master/_working/covid-tracking/'>available on GitHub</a>.

## The latest Covid-19 situation in Victoria, Australia

<object type="image/svg+xml" data='/img/covid-tracking/victoria-latest.svg' width='100%'><img src='/img/covid-tracking/victoria-latest.png' width='100%'></object>

For each of the three time series shown, the green segment on the left shows a period of time that is substantively settled. The brown/orange segment is a "nowcast" - still heavily impacted by delays in incubation and reporting, but with at least some partial data. The final blue segment is a forecast.

The darker part of each ribbon reflects the estimated 50% credibility interval - the range within which a particular variable (infections, cases, or effective reproduction number) is believed to have a 50% chance of occurring, were the truth to be known. The wider, paler part of each ribbon is a 90% credibility interval.
