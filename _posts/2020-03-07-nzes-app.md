I've just finished updating and deploying a [webtool that helps explore data from the New Zealand Election Study](https://ellisp.shinyapps.io/nzes-by-party/). I'd previously done this just with the results form the 2014 wave of the study; today I've added the results from 2017 and made a number of small improvements (eg getting the macrons back in to the 'M\U0101ori Party', something that defeated my timelines a couple of years ago).
