## Ten years of blog posts

A few months ago&mdash;26 July 2025 to be precise&mdash;was the tenth anniversary of my [first blog post](/blog/2015/07/26/hello-world). Over that time it turns out I've written about 225 blog posts, and an astonishing (to me) 350,000 words. That's after you take out the code.

Free Range Statistics is an old-fashioned blog, with a single author and very much representing the ideal of a "web log" just recording things of interest to me. I'll go a bit into what's kept me motivated later, but the spoiler is that, like art, blogging is in my opinion something best done primarily for your own interests and needs, and if anyone else likes it that's a bonus.

The ten years of blog history hasn't been an even one, but has had some ebbs and flows. We can see this in this chart of number of blog posts per month over time. 

The low point of post frequency was 2021 and 2022, when life events got in the way. I was very busy in my day job as Chief Data Scientist for Nous Group, and this also was fairly hands-on technical itself which reduced my motivation to write code to relax. I was also playing a lot of Elite Dangerous in this period (as Cmdr Quasipoisson in the Federal Liberal Command), right up to 2024 (when the civil unrest in Noumea led me to drop that cold turkey). And mid 2022 saw me change jobs and countries. In 2025 I've had health challenges, but these seem to be under control and I'm getting into a better <i>modus vivendi</i> with them.

<i>Code for these charts is at the bottom of the post. Two things worth noting about this one are how I've turned the months with zero posts into hollow circles, and used a continuous single model over all years instead of a separate model fit to each year-facet, which would be the easy default but does not really make sense given how time is continuous and all.</i>

The past couple of years has seen an uptick in my posting frequency, and I think this is going to continue.  I've got quite a backlog of half-finished posts to write about. These are on topics ranging from synthetic controls, to power and p-values, to lots of empirical stuff on the Pacific.

One thing that's happened over time is the posts have gotten longer and, in a sense, more thorough over time. Back when I wrote 45 posts in 2016&mdash;nearly one a week&mdash;they were short, very single topic, no great level of detail. More recently I am more inclined to try to thoroughly tease something out, particularly when I am learning for myself or trying to consolidate my understanding of something. A good example would be my recent set of posts on modelling fertility rates, which I had to split into two, one on [the substance](/blog/2025/08/15/timeuse-summary) and one on [the grab bag of things I learned on the way](http://127.0.0.1:4001/blog/2025/08/23/timeuse-technical).

Here's a connected scatter plot that lets us see both word count and posting frequency together, with some very crude characterisations of characteristic themes I was writing about at the time:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data='/img/0302-word-counts.svg' width='100%'><img src='/img/0302-word-counts.png' width='100%'></object>

While one does one's art for its own sake, there's no denying it's interesting to see what other people read in my blog too. I get a modest but steady trickle of around 60 unique visitors and 80-100 pages read a day.

I used to have an automated "most popular" listing but changes in analytics services over the blog's lifetime degraded this and I've pulled it. But from a more ad hoc examination using partial data from some mixed sources (too complicated to talk about here), here are some posts that have been most read recently:

* [Stepwise selection of variables in regression is Evil](/blog/2024/09/14/stepwise) (2025)
* [Skill v luck in determining backgammon winners](/blog/2016/03/19/elo-pr-luck) (2016) 
* [Relative risk ratios and odds ratios](/blog/2018/08/17/risk-ratios) (2018)
* [Weighted versus unweighted percentiles](/blog/2023/06/24/weighted-percentiles) (2023)
* [Log transforms, geometric means, and estimating population totals](/blog/2023/07/30/log-transforms) (2023)
* [Dual axis time series plots may be ok sometimes after all](/blog/2016/08/18/dualaxes) (2016) 
* [Extrapolation is tough for trees!](/blog/2016/12/10/extrapolation) (2016)
* [Snakes and ladders](/blog/2024/08/10/snakes-and-ladders) (2024)

This is interesting and I think is probably showing some external searches are turning up my blog on basic methodological questions. I'm pleased to say each of these posts does indeed have something useful in it&mdash;roughly defined as meaning I sometimes go back to them myself to see what I thought. So I hope other people are finding them of some use at the end of their random web search too.

If I had a longer series of analytics data I'm sure my various election-related posts and time series modelling posts would be in the genuine top hits. At one point it looked like some of my comparisons of forecasting methods were in the required reading for some courses, they were getting so many hits.

## Blong longevity benchmarks (not checked)

ChatGPT gave me this alleged summary of the literature on blog longevity. I got as far as checking the existence of the first chapter (affirmative), but don't have the time and money (ie access) to check these all. So use with caution. But it's fair to say the number in here are plausible, and they suggest that a blog that's lasted 10 years with an average of 20 posts per year is pretty unusual.

## Why I write my blog


so why do it publicly at all? transparency forces you to be rigorous


Ten years is a success, I guess. Most blogs are abandoned after a few months, so what kept me motivated to keep writing for ten years?

In my very first blog post I wrote:

> "I don’t see a technically oriented blog that covers the complete range of issues of interest to me - advances in statistical techniques; the links between reproducible computing analysis and high quality scientific research; visualisation of data for non-specialist audiences; and applying high quality, recently developed methods to new and old data to answer old and new questions, with a particular focus on New Zealand"

Well, I'm not sure that was true either then or now (that is, the lack of a blog covering those things); except with that "particular focus on New Zealand" part, which isn't that relevant to me any more. I've moved countries twice over this time period (to Australia and then to New Caledonia) and my subject matter has (slightly) evolved based on my location and job.

But correct or not, that quote from my first post really doesn't explain my motivations for the blog over the ten years since. In fact, reading it now, it seems to me that I was somewhat in a state of mauvaise foi trying to justify the blog as an act of filling a niche for the public good, when really I didn't have to do so.

kay ponts out i did know at the time i wasnted to lern but didn't say so in this post

My motivations have certainly evolved over time as I settled into a rhythm of writing and publishing posts. Compared to when I set out, I can give a much more accurate picture of why I'm really doing this.

First and I would say foremost, I've found the blog an environment to *exercise and extend my hands-on technical craft* in ways that I can't do in my work. Most of those ten years (including at the very beginning, and also right now) I've been in managerial roles. In these sorts of jobs, opening up R is likely to get me in trouble (or more likely, feeling guilty on my own account) for not working to role. I should be inspiring and directing others to be writing code, not doing it myself; at least in terms of conventional expectations of people in these roles. 

Having a blog where I "keep my hand in" doing technical stuff myself lets me do several things that would otherwise be difficult:
* I can be a better manager of people who *are* doing these things in their work&mdash;making sure I know what is possible, and keeping up with good practice. For example, in all of my managerial and leadership jobs I play a role of random repository auditor&mdash;I should be able to freshly clone any Git repo the team are working on and, after any necessary faffing about for data access, run it to produce the outputs. I also ask for the link to the repository for any report or piece of analysis I am asked to approve; I may or may not actually run the code but keeping myself familiar with good practice gives me a huge head start in deciding if I have the confidence to approve the product. This sort of thing is made much easier by me maintaining familiarity with the tools by playing around with my blog on a regular basis.
* I can learn new things and try out ideas, with or without an idea of applying these at work. A good example might be [this idea of updating the UN cohort component population projections with a more recent census result](/blog/2024/05/05/pop-projections). We haven't actually applied this at work, but it's certainly led to some interesting discussions. Sometimes it's helpful to lead from the front, to be able to say "well I had a go and you can read the blog about it here, don't you think that we could use something like that method?". 
* It means that on the rare occasion when I have a genuine need to personally write code at work (most common application is producing a chart for a presentation) I can do it quickly and well.

Second motivation is a slightly different take and is my own long term professional development. I am by orientation a compulsive life-long learner. I am very proud of and committed to my accreditation with the Statistical society of Australia and determined to stay on top of my applied field to the degree possible. But no education and work experience can cover the full range of applied statistics; there are always new techniques to learn. It turns out that for me there is *no better way of learning* about, say, propensity score matching, than forcing myself to do it for real in a blog post that is going to be read by at least a few of my peers.

Related to this&mdash;I just find it fun, and relaxing, to play around with code, and describe this as motivation number three. My blog-source repository is an environment I can open when I have ideas, see something puzzling on social media or in a book I'm reading, and just play around with data. This is particularly useful for when I find myself thinking "is that really the case?" in response to something I've read. It's great to start up a script, do a bit of exploring, and know that I can either drop it or work it up into a blog post over time if I'm learning something and it seems interesting enough.

Only in position number four is the motivation to actually *communicate some facts and ideas*. How important motivation four is has varied over time, and it's never been particularly important. There were periods when I published election forecasts for New Zealand that had no other equivalent at the time, and some Covid modelling in Australia, where communicating actual issues was the most important thing for my blog, but these didn't (and almost certainly, couldn't possibly, given my energy and interest levels) last. Perhaps the high point blog post that I really wanted people to read was my [exposure of Surgisphere](/blog/2020/05/30/implausible-health-data-firm), which made me Twitter-famous for a few days and was an important contribution to an investigation by the Guardian and then retraction of an article in the Lancet (surprisingly but gratifyingly rapidly).

I got bored of forecasting elections fairly quickly. I am actually more interested in understanding [voting behaviour](/blog/voting.html) through analysis of data such as in the Australian and New Zealand election studies, but the public was always more focused on forecasts. I got into these originally as an intellectual exercise, to learn about state space models and then to see if I could apply them to the distinctive New Zealand electoral system. Then there was interest in maintaining the data and models to do regular, semi-automated updates. But after a couple of cycles in New Zealand and Australia I'd had enough of that. 

Motivation four has never been strong for me, even though that quote from my first blog post suggests otherwise. This blog is for me; I have a day job that is more about informing the publi. It's actually a tremendous luxury in this blog to not care very much about my audience&mdash;reminiscent of the ["who cares if you listen"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Cares_if_You_Listen%3F) ethos of serialist composer Milton Babbit. Unlike Babbit, I'm not saying my blogs are too complex for a "normally well-educated man without special preparation" to understand, as much as that, because of motivations one through three, I just don't think about the audience that much. I am pretty sure that this callous deprioritisation of my audience has been necessary to maintain the blog for 10 years, as otherwise I would have probably given up the blog as inefficient and ineffective (it's hardly a mass readership exercise) long ago.

Fifth and final motivation in this list is networking and publicity. I'm certainly not into blogging for fame (or I hope I would do differently and better than I am), but I do seek to use my posts in a certain way to broaden and strengthen my professional networks. I publicise my posts on Bluesky and LinkedIn, sometimes Facebook (and until 2024 on Twitter). They are a way of getting myself known to niche audiences, and very occasionally a way to achieve an objective for my day job by publicising something cool we're doing, positions we're recruiting, or an issue we're concerned about.

## Change over time


## Technical stuff about the blog

Really wanted to avoid having a blog about blogs so haven't written much about this

Really like that I don't have to think about how I do this and basically have only 2 or 3 times in ten years had to worry about it

Still proudly using Jekyll

quite manual - i like the flexibility to place code snippets myself wherever I want them

nested git repositories

svg_png function; fonts

redesign

syntax highlighting

r-bloggers syndication - RSS - anything else

## Word count code
