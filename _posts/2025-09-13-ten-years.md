A couple of months ago&mdash;26 July 2025 to be precise&mdash;the tenth anniversary of my [first blog post](/blog/2015/07/26/hello-world)

## Some things I wrote about

trying to get on top of methods, of which time series focus was just one example but others are propensity score matching and indeed election forecasting
elections - both the forecasting but also the more interesting voting behaviour stuff. And eventually i got bored with this
covid
surgisphere
interesting things in history, development data, etc. these days these are more likely to be focused on the Pacific
plot polishing, animations, clever things to do with R

## Which posts are popular


## My changing relationship to the blog

Definite influence of my job on what I write. Very rarely, work related in the sense of trying to advertise things at work. While a consultant, saw it as an asset in getting work but realistically always knew the client base are not readers of blogs like this. Nowadays I will use the blog to dive into a tangentially work-related issue (eg on PNG) and then post just one angle of it on LinkedIn

Changes in R

## Technical stuff about the blog

Really wanted to avoid having a blog about blogs so haven't written much about this

Really like that I don't have to think about how I do this and basically have only 2 or 3 times in ten years had to worry about it

Still proudly using Jekyll

quite manual - i like the flexibility to place code snippets myself wherever I want them

nested git repositories

svg_png function; fonts

redesign

syntax highlighting

r-bloggers syndication - RSS - anything else

## Word count code

Here's the code that produced the charts shown earlier in this post:

{% highlight R lineanchors %}

library(tidyverse)
library(stylo) # for delete.markup
library(glue)
library(ggtext)

#---------------Import and process blog posts-------------
blog_names <- list.files("../_posts", full.names = TRUE)
blogs <- tibble()

for(i in 1:length(blog_names)){
  blogs[i, "full"] <- paste(readLines(blog_names[i]), collapse = " ")
  blogs[i, "filename"] <- gsub("../_posts/", "", blog_names[i], fixed = TRUE)
}


blogs <- blogs |> 
  mutate(no_jekyll = gsub("\\{\\% highlight R.*?\\%\\}.*?\\{\\% endhighlight \\%\\}", " ", full),
         txt = "")

# delete markup only works on one string at a time, seems easiest to do it in a loop:
for(i in 1:nrow(blogs)){
  blogs[i, ]$txt <- delete.markup(blogs[i, ]$no_jekyll, markup.type = "html")
}

# a few more basic stats per blog post:
blogs <- blogs |> 
  mutate(word_count = stringi::stri_count_words(txt),
          word_count_with_tags = stringi::stri_count_words(no_jekyll),
          date = as.Date(str_extract(filename, "^[0-9]*-[0-9]*-[0-9]*")),
          month = month(date),
