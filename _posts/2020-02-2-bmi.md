description: I put to the test a method of running a tennis tournament suggested by Lewis Carroll. It performs ok in allocating prizes fairly, although it takes about twice as many matches as a standard modern single-elimination. When there is realistic randomness in results it doesn't perform as well as Carroll argued it would on the unrealistic basis of deterministic match outcomes.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is an attempt to give a quick back-of-envelope answer to the question "if someone weighs W kg, is that a lot or not very much?" Clearly the answer to that question has to take into account the person's height; in general, whatever may constitute a healthy weight, it has to be higher for tall people . So BMI, the weight (in kilograms) divided by the height squared (in metres) gives a scaled version of weight that aims to be rougly comparable for people of different heights. It is actually extremely successful in this regard; certainly it tells you a *lot* more about someone than either the weight or height individuially.

However, BMI is one of those single dimensional metrics that gets widespread criticism, much of it on account of being a single dimensional metric. Criticisms of these types of measures typically come in three varieties: 

1. reality is much more complex than any single measure X could represent
2. ...but if you tweaked it (by method Y) it would somehow be much better
3. ...anyway, I think Z is really important. X is a really bad measure of Z.

I think Gross Domestic Product wins the award for attracting the biggest collection of criticisms in this pattern, but BMI would be high up in the list of also-rans. I won't bother linking to individual articles, because googling ["why is BMI a bad measure"](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+BMI+a+bad+measure&oq=why+is+BMI+a+bad+measure&aqs=chrome..69i57.5687j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) comes up with too many to choose from.

The first of those criticisms is always correct, but uninteresting given we need to somehow model the world into a simpler form to grasp it. 

The third is nearly always a red herring. In particular it usually introduces a straw man fallacy, accusing the metric of not being something it never claimed to be. This diverts discussion into technical areas when the real disagreement is about something more substantive. 

The second criticism ("if you tweaked it, it would be better") can be interesting and fruitful, but in my experience is often standing as a proxy for one of the other two criticisms, which can cause more confusion and talking-past-one-another.

BMI attracts criticisms in all three categories. Clearly, a person's state of health is much more complex than can be represented by a single number and "BMI doesn't tell the whole story" (criticism one with a smattering of three). Equally clearly, sometimes whether someone is obese, normal weight or underweight is not the most important thing to know about them (criticism three). BMI is an inaccurate measure of body fat content (well, yes, of course) and a 'terrible measure of health' (still the straw man of criticism three). Overwhelmingly obesity and high BMI is associated with poor health outcomes, but in some unusual or perhaps statistically suspect circumstances obesity seems to be a protective factor (criticism three - again, not clear why this is seen as a critique of BMI as a *measure* rather than an interesting fact about how that measure relates to ohter outcomes). Some very well-muscled and clearly healthy individuals have high BMIs that would put them in the 'overweight' category by WHO standards (I think this is a variant of criticsm 1 with a dusting of 3). Or BMI is just calculated the wrong way - it should have height to the factor of 2.5, not 2 (criticism 2).

I want to (mostly) ignore this debate, not because its not important and interesting (it is clearly both) but because I don't have enough time and space just now. I *do* want to zoom in on criticism 2 however, and in particular the claim that  ["BMI exaggerates thinness in short people and fatness in tall people"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215). Relatedly, I wonder (as I'm sure many many people have before me), why divide weight by height to the power of 2? Why 2? Why not 3, given that if people of different heights had the same proportions we would expect weight to be proportionate to height cubed?

You don't have to follow your nose far in the discussions on BMI to come across references to [Oxford University Professor of Numerical Analaysis](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/) Nick Trefethen's letter to the *Economist* on 5 January 2013:

> SIR - The body-mass index that you (and the National Health Service) count on to assess obesity is a bizarre measure. We live in a three-dimensional world, yet the BMI is defined as weight divided by height squared. It was invented in the 1840s, before calculators, when a formula had to be very simple to be usable. As a consequence of this ill-founded definition, millions of short people think they are thinner than they are, and millions of tall people think they are fatter.

Trefethen [elsewhere](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bmi.html) expands on his idea of a BMI for the post-calculator age, providing the archetypal exemplar of my second criticism category. His proposed approach is to put height to the power of 2.5, and scale the result by multiplying it by 1.3 so the numbers are similar to the current familiar range:

> New formula: BMI = 1.3 * weight(kg) / height(m) ^ 2.5

The scaling (which is designed to make the new BMI identical to the old for someone who is 1.69 metres tall) seems an unnecessary complication; after all BMI is a completely artificial measure and we can put the boundaries for underweight, healthy, overweight etc wherever we wish; if we want a "new BMI" measure there is no reason for it to appear similar in magnitude to the old one (and in fact some good arguments against).

Trefethen's views are mentioned in most post-2013 critiques of BMI, nearly always completely uncritically, for example in the subheading "BMI exaggerates thinness in short people and fatness in tall people" in [this MedicalNewsToday piece](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215#BMI-exaggerates-thinness-in-short-people-and-fatness-in-tall-people), which quotes Trefethen as saying "Certainly if you plot typical weights of people against their heights, the result comes out closer to height ^ 2.5 than height ^ 2" (I haven't been able to find the original source of this, but it certainly is consistent with what I have been able to find written by Trefethen).

Very well. Let us look at some data. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an extraordinary on-going survey of around 400,000 adult interviews each year. It claims to be the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world, and I imagine it is one of the largest continuous surveys of any purpose. It includes questions on (self-reported) height and weight as well as standard demographics.

Defence of BMI can be incoherent too, such as that it should only be used for population measures not for individuals.

### Code

Here's all the R code for these simulations in a single chunk. A `carroll_tournament()` function is the work horse, with a couple of helpers for very specific tasks such as `one_match()` which plays out a single match using either a deterministic or probabilistic method of allocating a winner.
