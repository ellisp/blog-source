description: Excellent statistical graphics usually reveal multivariate interactions and comparisons, and combine high data density with a minimum of ink that doesn't directly represent data.

Last week I gave a seminar for around 40 analysts from another government agency on using graphics to represent data.  In doing such presentations, I usually focus on different purposes of graphics:

* exploratory
* as part of the analysis workflow (eg as diagnosis for statistical models)
* for presenting results

Exactly what the purpose is makes quite a difference to how you go about developing the graphic - and how long you spend polishing of course.  

I'm heavily influenced by Tufte's idea of "Graphical Excellence".  Here's a Tufte-inspired taster of an alternative to a side-by-side barchart:

OK, it's not perfect, and it doesn't mean much without its context, but it gives an idea...

This particular presentation was a cut-down version of a seminar session I give at the beginning of a five week (5 x 90 minutes) internal training course on Graphics Fundamentals, with the next four sessions all hands-on implementing the principles with R, layered grammar of graphics and `ggplot2`.

Making slides available without the context of the talk is always dangerous.  If the slides are self-sufficient, you're not doing it right.  They should be props, not scripts.  Nonetheless, they might be of some interest even for those who weren't there (a bit like Jeopardy - try to imagine what points the speaker is trying to make at different points).  

This particular set of slides makes use of the [`reveal.js` HTML presentation framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and in particular RStudio's easy-to-use [R Markdown plugin `revealjs`](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs) which makes it super easy to integrate R code and graphics into a nice-looking presentation.  I don't have any R code in this presentation - it was deliberately software-neutral - but I use `revealjs` all the time for training material and it's fantastic to have a snippet of code so easily integrated.  And the general look and feel of `reveal.js` is extremely pleasant.  

`reveal.js` supports two-dimensional presentations, which means you can navigate through the slides in a slightly more sophisticated way than PowerPoint.  Tip for navigating - just keep using `PgDn` if the arrows are confusing you!

Browse:

* the [presentation slides on using graphics to represent data](/presentations/graphics-intro.html).
* the [source code](https://github.com/ellisp/graphics-taster/blob/master/graphics-ird.Rmd) - which won't be fully reproducible because of some data availability issues, but will give you a good idea.
