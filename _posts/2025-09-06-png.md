I [wrote a review](https://devpolicy.org/a-gripping-birds-eye-view-of-50-years-of-pngs-economic-change-20250905/) last week of *Struggle, reform, boom and bust: an economic history of Papua New Guinea since independence* by Stephen Howes and others, for the Devpolicy Blog at The Australian National University's Development Policy Centre in the Crawford School of Public Policy. My post today is teasing out a few data-related issues I thought about and explored while reading the book and writing that review.

## Real GDP per person

First there is this chart of real gross domestic product (GDP) per person, which differs a bit from the one I included in my review:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data='/img/0304-gdp-with-cpi.svg' width='100%'><img src='/img/0304-gdp-with-cpi.png' width='100%'></object>

In fact, it's closer to [a chart used by PNG's Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey](https://devpolicy.org/struggle-reform-boom-and-bust-a-profound-wake-up-call-for-png-20250821/) when launched the book at University of PNG on 20 August. The Treasurer chose to use consumer price index (CPI) rather than the GDP deflator to make prices comparable over time. His rationale was to highlight changes in living standards for ordinary Papua New Guineans. He also dropped the full GDP series, to focus on non-resources GDP, for the same reason. These are both reasonable choices. Their combined impact is to make greatly visible the decline in average living standards over the independence period, from around 11,000 kina per person in 2024 prices 50 years ago, to 8,500 today during the "slow bust" period identified in the book in question.

For the choice of CPI versus GDP deflator, it is all about the basket of goods used to make up the price index - what the average household consumes, or what is produced in the counttry. In an earlier 2022 work (referred to in my original review linked above), Howes explicitly suggested using CPI as a deflator when interested in how much consumers can buy with their notional share of GDP, and the GDP deflator when looking to compare the value of what is produced in the country. For a general discussion of economic well-being in Papua New Guinea, I agree with the use of CPI. In my review I went with the GDP deflator instead only because that meant I was effectively replicating a chart from the book; I didn't want to go too far into my own analysis.

The issue of GDP or non-resource GDP is an interesting one, and is extensively discussed in the book. I chose to include them both because the divergence, particularly during the latest "bust" period, is of importance in its own right. Economic activity that is indirectly caused by resources is still included in non-resource GDP (for example, government activity funded with taxes; and value added in domestic industries that workers from the resource industry purchase goods and services from). Howes et al would have used Gross National Income or some variant of it if they could but it isn't published.

The other issues with this chart are just some finer points of chart polishing: the decision to use grey background rectangles rather than vertical lines (more cluttering, in my view) to distinguish the four phases; where to include the label annotations of each phase; and the use of direct labels on the two time series instead of a more conventional (but more effort for the reader) legend.

One of the great things about this book is that all the economic time-series data behind it has been published, and is kept up to date by ANU, as the [PNG Economic Database](https://pngeconomic.devpolicy.org/).

## Population

The most fundamental national statistic is always population, and unfortunately for PNG there is more than usual uncertainty about how many people live in the country. A census in PNG - with its geographical, linguistic, cultural, political and security challenges - is one of the harder exercises in official statistics collection anywhere in the world. The key facts regarding population estimates are:

* The 2024 Census, delayed from 2021 because of Covid, is due to report soon
* The 2011 Census has been criticised; the 2000 Census is often referred to as "the last credible population estimate" or in similar terms
* An exercise by the national statistics office and WorldPop in 2023 published an estimated population for 2021. The method used machine learning to estimate population from satellite imagery trained on a malaria survey to provide the "ground truth" population estimates. the result (11.7m in 2021) was high by existing standards, but not out of the possible range.
* Various modelled estimates, drawing on some or all of the above (plus earlier censuses) in differing ways exist. 

The state of play with regard to PNG's population estimates is represented in the following chart:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data='/img/0304-population.svg' width='100%'><img src='/img/0304-population.png' width='100%'></object>

The Census and WorldPop point estimates have been joined with a grey line because at the time of writing (early September 2025) they represent the official statistics on the PNG National Statistics Office website. The UN Population Projections, which are re-disseminated via the Pacific Community's Pacific Data Hub, and the population estimates in the ANU PNG economic database are shown instead as smooth lines.

The growth between 2011 and 2021 implied by accepting the 2011 Census and 2021 WorldPop estimates is implausibly rapid (4.9% per year), but there is no way of determining if the 2011 figure is an undercount, the 2021 an overestimate, or both. 

The ANU's estimate&mdash;which ultimately go back to [modelling efforts by Bourke and Allen in 2021](https://pngeconomic.devpolicy.org/data-notes/)&mdash;are probably a little low, a point made by the Treasurer when he launched the book. But again, not out of the plausible range. 

A lot depends on the 2024 census.
