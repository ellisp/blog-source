#' Version of fisher.pval that won't break if k1 and k2 both 0
tough_fisher <- function(k1, n1, k2, n2, set_both_zero = 1, ...){
  problems <- k1 + k2 == 0
  k1[problems] <- 1
  temp <- fisher.pval(k1, n1, k2, n2)
  temp[problems] <- set_both_zero
  return(temp)
}
# note need a decision on what to do when k1 and k2 are both zero. I think
# p value is 1 here, as p is the "probability of seeing data at least as extreme
# as this if the null hypothesis of no difference is true". Not sure why Fisher's
# exact test returns an error, worth looking into that. My 'hand' method below
# gives NaN because the estimated variance is 0 andyou have 0/0, probably similar
# problem to that.
